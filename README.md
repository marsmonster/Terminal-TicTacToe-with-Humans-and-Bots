# Terminal-TicTacToe-with-Humans-and-Bots

This little project implements a __TicTacToe__-game that can be played on the command line. 

Whether you want to spice up your lunch break by competing with a fellow human being or you want to challenge yourself by battling a medium-smart Bot, this little program is for you.

If you don't quite feel the spark of intellectual challenge today, you can also just sit back, relax, and watch two Bots doing the hard work for you. The choice is yours.

## Installation

To run the program you should have a Ruby interpreter installed. This project was created using Ruby version 2.7.0

There is no need to install anything else. Just clone this repository to your local machine and you are good to go.


## Usage

To start the game, choose the cloned repository as your working directory. 

Then call:

```ruby

ruby main.rb

```

The game starts with a mainmenu that will guide you through the game. It will first show you a short introduction, then give you the opportunity to choose your players, as well as their names and symbols.

Everytime a match is completed you can choose if you want to continiue with another round or quit the game.
